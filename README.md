Hexa Architecture Server Template

This repository contains two ready-to-copy templates:

- `monolith-template/` - Modular Monolith using FastAPI and Hexagonal architecture
- `microservices-template/` - Mono-repo layout with multiple services (each a hexagonal FastAPI service)

Pick the template that best suits your project and copy it into a new repository or adapt.

Next steps:
- To scaffold a fresh project from the monolith template, copy the `monolith-template/` folder into a new repo and replace names.
- To start developing a service from the microservices template, cd into `microservices-template/services/<service-name>` and follow its README.
