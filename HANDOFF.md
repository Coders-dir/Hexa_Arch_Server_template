Handoff Summary — Hexagonal Server Templates

This document summarizes the current repository state, required secrets, deploy steps, remaining tasks, and an estimated minimal prompt plan for final handoff.

1) Current state (snapshot)
- Two independent templates:
  - `monolith-template/` — FastAPI hexagonal monolith, Dockerfile, docker-compose, pytest tests, k8s manifests (app, redis, nginx, prometheus, alertmanager, fluentbit), GitHub Actions CI and CD.
  - `microservices-template/services/user-service/` — FastAPI user microservice with its own k8s manifests, docker-compose, tests, CI and CD.
- Local E2E smoke scripts and pytest tests included and verified previously in the dev container.
- CD workflows render Alertmanager config at deploy time when `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` secret is present and create `alerting-secrets` k8s secret.
- Prometheus and Alertmanager manifests added to both templates. Prometheus rules exist as both PrometheusRule CR and a rules ConfigMap (for non-Operator setups).

2) Required repository / environment secrets (GitHub Actions)
- KUBE_CONFIG (base64-encoded kubeconfig for the target cluster)
- DATABASE_URL_PROD (production DB URL)
- JWT_SECRET
- GHCR credentials if pushing images to GHCR (or rely on GITHUB_TOKEN)
- ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL (optional) — webhook for Alertmanager receiver, will create k8s secret `alerting-secrets` if present
- SOPS_AGE_KEY (optional) — if using SOPS-encrypted manifests under `infra/secrets/`
- SENTRY_DSN (optional)

3) Deploy (what CD does)
- Push to `main` triggers CD.
- CD decodes `KUBE_CONFIG`, creates namespace `prod`, creates `app-secrets` and optionally `alerting-secrets`, optionally decrypts SOPS files, then applies manifests in this order: alertmanager config -> alertmanager deployment/service -> prometheus config/rules/configmap -> prometheus deployment/service -> application deployment/service.

4) Remaining high-value items (recommended)
- Add real Alertmanager receivers (Slack/email) and verify secret handling. Current approach renders a webhook URL into a ConfigMap at deploy time.
- Configure Fluent Bit output (Loki/Elasticsearch/Cloud) — Fluent Bit manifest present but destination not configured.
- Add Grafana dashboards and optionally a Prometheus scrape/recording rules package.
- Harden RBAC, PodSecurity policies, NetworkPolicies (initial RBAC/NetworkPolicy added; review per cluster policy).
- Implement global rate-limiting if required (recommend Traefik/Kong for multi-replica coordinated limits; NGINX alone is local to Ingress controller replica).
- Move manifests to Helm or Kustomize for environment parameterization and safer templating.
- Add integration tests for CD (dry-run checks) and automations to validate SOPS rendering and secret provisioning.

5) Minimal on-prem validation status
- K8s client-side `kubectl apply --dry-run=client` could not validate against a cluster in this environment; YAML files were parsed and created locally but server-side validation requires a reachable kube-apiserver.

6) Handoff plan & estimated prompts to finish (minimal)
I will finish the remaining items autonomously if you want, but here is a minimal prompt plan to reach a production-ready handoff you can accept:
- Prompt 1 (this turn): Confirm I should produce final artifacts (I created `HANDOFF.md`) and proceed to add Alertmanager receiver templates + Fluent Bit output wiring and Grafana dashboards. If yes, I will implement them.
- Prompt 2: I create a final review PR (or branch) with all changes, and generate a short runbook with exact GitHub secret names and the deploy checklist. You review and request any minor adjustments.
- Prompt 3: Final sign-off and I provide the PR link and a one-page ops handoff (commands to trigger deploy, smoke-test checklist, rollback steps).

Estimated prompts: 1–3 (I can complete everything in 2 prompts if you accept the receiver choices and logging destination I pick — otherwise up to 3 for review/adjustment).

7) Immediate next actions I have completed or will run now
- Created `HANDOFF.md` in repo root (this file).
- Render pipeline & CD updates already implemented to render Alertmanager config at deploy time.
- Prometheus + Alertmanager deployments and services added for both templates.

If you want me to continue with the remaining automation (add Slack/email receiver templates, Fluent Bit output to Loki, and a minimal Grafana dashboard + create a PR with all changes), I will proceed now and complete it within the next prompt.
