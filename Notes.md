What this project is (short)
A FastAPI-based monolith template with:

a small admin API and prototype admin UI,
a Redis-backed quota/priority queue and circuit helpers (redis_quota.py),
database adapters (Postgres/Mongo), test docker compose (docker-compose.test.yml) and CI + tests. It’s a development scaffold for building services with common infra wired and tested.
Key capabilities / power
Ready dev stack: one command to bring Postgres/Mongo/Redis up (via docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d) and run the app.
Production-like components: Redis for rate/priority queues, Postgres for durable API keys, motor for Mongo, FastAPI + uvicorn for HTTP endpoints.
Built-in patterns: hexagonal structure (adapters/ports), reusable components (quota manager, circuit breaker).
Tests and CI: unit/integration tests and GitHub Actions for smoke and integration runs — lowers developer friction for verifying changes.
Extensible admin tooling: prototype Admin UI + API to manage keys, quick for ops tasks.
How this helps a quant developer (concrete)
Rapid experiment service: stand up the full stack locally and expose a HTTP API to run strategy sims or pricing endpoints — no infra wiring required.
Rate limiting & queuing: use the QuotaManager for throttling model inference calls or scheduling priority jobs (low-latency jobs can be prioritized).
Lightweight scheduler/circuit support: automatic transient failure handling for external providers (exchanges, pricing feeds) via circuit helpers.
Reproducible CI checks: your model-serving changes can be validated by the existing tests and smoke scripts before merge.
Integration-ready: adapters make it easy to swap data stores (in-memory -> Postgres/Mongo) for backtesting vs production.
Easy to extend: add a microservice or worker using existing patterns and test harnesses.
Examples:

Run a model host that accepts jobs with priority; devs can integrate with the Redis priority queue to schedule urgent risk calculations.
Protect costly calls (third-party pricing) using record_failure / is_circuit_open to avoid cascading failures.
Use scripts/run_postman_smoke.py and CI to validate end-to-end behavior after model updates.
Limits, constraints, and what to NOT do
Technical / performance limits

Not a low-latency HFT platform. This template runs in Python/FastAPI with Redis and is not optimized for microsecond-latency or kernel-bypass networking.
Single-process assumptions: the monolith and in-memory repositories are not horizontally scalable by default; you must design for scaling (stateless services, shared caches) before production traffic.
Redis design caveats: the priority queue uses integer composite scores and a Lua fallback — correct under typical loads but can have edge cases under concurrent high-throughput writes (race conditions if ZREM fails or wrong member formats). Test under your expected concurrency.
Circuit & quota are simple: they are fine for many use-cases but are not a replacement for mature circuit-breaker libraries with sliding-window analytics or distributed rate-limiting (token buckets via Redis tokens, etc).
Security & compliance limits

Secrets: repo has examples that assume env-based secrets (e.g., JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL). Do NOT store production secrets in the repo or commit them. Use a secrets manager.
Auth: the admin token approach is simple. For production, use strong auth (OAuth, mTLS), rotation, and audit logging.
Data protection: not GDPR/PCI-complete — if you process regulated data, add encryption-at-rest, auditing, and retention policies.
Operational limits

CI and compose actions are tuned for dev/test. For real deployments use proper k8s manifests, observability (traces), and production-grade health checks/load balancing.
Tests: current suite covers many paths but is not exhaustive for your models or market-edge cases — add domain-specific acceptance tests.
Legal / business limits

This template is a starting point. Don’t assume legal or regulatory fit for trading or production financial services without compliance review.
What to respect / best practices
Treat this repo as a dev scaffold: run tests poetry run pytest, use docker compose test stack for integration.
Keep secrets out of the code; use env or secret store.
Load-test any queue/circuit logic with realistic concurrency before trusting in production.
Implement monitoring/alerting and persistent logging before handling real money or live trading signals.
Add SLOs & capacity planning if you’re moving to production.
Short checklist for a quant team to move to production
Add strong auth & secrets management.
Replace in-memory stores with durable, replicated stores and migration paths.
Add rate-limiter backed by a robust algorithm (redis token-bucket or dedicated rate-limiter service).
Harden the queue (atomic operations, idempotency tokens, visibility timeouts).
Add metrics, distributed tracing, and alerting.
Run load and chaos tests.
Next actions I can do for you
Add a short “How to use for quant devs” README section with commands and examples.
Benchmark the QuotaManager under simulated load and summarize limits.
Add a pre-deploy checklist or production-hardening PR template.
