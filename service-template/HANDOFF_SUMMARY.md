Handoff summary — minimal, actionable

Summary
-------
This branch contains a small hexagonal-monolith template with a dispatcher/quota system and an Admin API for API keys. I hardened the DB persistence initialization, added lightweight CI and a short handoff with verification steps.

What I changed (delta)
- `src/app/adapters/outbound/api_key_repo.py` — added exponential backoff + jitter and structured logging for asyncpg pool init; added a per-call fallback with short retries for create operations.
- `monolith-template/DEV_HANDOFF.md` — quick run instructions to start services and run tests.
- `monolith-template/.github/workflows/ci-integration.yml` — minimal GitHub Actions job to boot Postgres/Redis/Mongo, apply migrations, and run tests.

Verification performed (live)
- Started the test stack via `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d`.
- Live I/O checks run against services (ping/write/read):
  - Redis: ping true, set/get returned "value123"
  - Mongo: inserted and retrieved {'_id':'ci1','val':'hello'}
  - Postgres: temporary table insert/read returned {"x": 1}
- Full test suite run with RUN_INTEGRATION=1: 13 passed, 2 warnings.

How to reproduce locally
------------------------
1. Start services:

```bash
cd service-template
docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d
```

2. Run tests:

```bash
export RUN_INTEGRATION=1
poetry install --no-interaction
poetry run pytest -q
```

Notes / decisions I made (CTO calls)
- Keep production changes minimal: the code uses an in-app scheduler suitable for local dev; for production run the scheduler as a separate worker.
- Pool init uses short exponential retries and explicit logs to aid debugging; we avoided adding external metrics dependencies to keep the surface small.

Next recommended steps (minimal, non-blocking)
1. Add a tiny metrics hook for DB pool-init failures (prometheus counter or structured logs) — low priority.
2. CI polish: store migration artifacts and improve caching in the CI workflow — optional.
3. Move the scheduler to a separate worker process for production — medium priority.

Prompt/token estimates and handoff budget
- This session: you allowed 4 prompts; I used the available prompts to implement and verify the changes.
- Final handoff (expanded runbook + CI polish + metrics) estimate: 2 prompts. Allocate ~300 tokens for that handoff if you want a richer package.

This is the final handoff snapshot for this session. For the prioritized next steps and implementation guidance see `../NEXT_DEVELOPMENT.md`.

Status: repo is test-green locally (13 tests passed). No further actions will be taken in this session.
